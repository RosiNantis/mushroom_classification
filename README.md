An image recognition project where different Deep Learning models are deployed to be able to recognise the species of Fungis given in picture or from camera.

This project was created as a final project for graduating from the SPICED ACADEMY, Data Science. In this app I used data from two different Kaggle projects where I used 10 different Fungi species of 1000 images from each one. The data were resized in 224*224 in RGB and then split in (75/15/10) % train/validation/test data respectively. I used several pre-trained CNN models and after tuning of the hyper parameters I concluded that the best model is the MobileNetV2. As a next step I trained the model with 3 extra layers resulting in an accuracy of 76%. I used Flask to create an app that can identify Fungis either from the list of test images or from a web-camera. The prediction finally was linked with the respective Wikipedia page where the description of the Fungi is given along with a picture of it, for comparison. Furthermore I used NLP in order to make a short abstract of the description of the Fungi.

## Introduction
> The mushroom classification application was created as a final project for graduating from the 3-months bootcamp in Spiced Academy that I have participated 
the Spring of 2022. Arguably it is a well established project with numerous different versions. Nevertheless it is a refreshing, funny as well as demanding to an
extend idea, in which I managed to extend my knowledge in ANN and CNN. 
> This project aims to identify a fungi in between 10 different species. Using a wikipedia API more information about the classified fungi is given from 
wikipedia and a short abstract is created using a simple NLP pretrained model. 
> The results are presented in an html format using Flask and an overview of the use of the app is shown below.

## Overview
> The project uses datasets from two Kaggle projects [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fungiclef2022/data) and [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images). Due to the large amount of different species and the large disparity between the amount of data per category, 10 species were selected with over 1000 images per category. 
> A total of over `10000` images belonging to 10 different, size-balanced classes were selected (`Russula`, `Plicatura crispa`, `Pleurotus ostreatus` etc.).<br>
> Apart from several attempts of ANN architectures that concluded to low accuracy predictions, four high accuracy CNN architectures were tested, __ResNet50V2_ [[3]](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet_v2/ResNet50V2), __MobileNetV2__ [[4]](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/), __InceptionResNetV2__ [[5]](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/), __EfficientNetB4__ [[6]](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet/EfficientNetB4).<br>
> Use of the wikipedia API [[7]](https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/) was used to have access of the wikipedia content and images of the identified from the model fungi.<br>
> A pretrained NLP model __Pegasus-xsum__[[8]](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-xsum) was used to give a one-sentence abstract of the fungi description that wikepedia gives.
> The results obtained from the different architectures were then evaluted and compared. The final project was created in an html format using python with the hepl of Flask.<br>

## Conclusions
> - DenseNet-121 having only `7.98 Million` parameters did relatively better than VGG-16 and ResNet-18, with `138 Million` and `11.17 Million` parameters respectively.
> - Increase in model's parameter count doesnâ€™t necessarily achieve better results, but increase in residual connections might.
> - Oversampling helped in dealing with imbalanced data to a great extent.
> - Fine-tuning helped substantially by dealing with the comparatively small dataset and speeding up the training process.
> - GradCAM aided in localizing the areas in CXRs that decides a model's predictions.
> - The models did a good job distinguishing various infectious and inflammatory lung diseases, which is rather hard manually, as mentioned earlier.
